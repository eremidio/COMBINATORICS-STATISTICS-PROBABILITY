# COMBINATORICS---STATISTICS---PROBABILITY
THIS REPOSITORY WILL CONTAINS MANY MATHEMATICAL ALGORITHMS CONCERNING COMBINATORICS, STATISTICS, PROBABILITY THEORY AND SOME OTHER RELATED TOPICS.


OBSERVATIONS: HERE WE SHALL NOT IMPLEMENT THE CLASS OF PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR ALGORITHMS KNOWN AS LINEAR FEEDBACK SHIFT REGISTER AND XORSHIFT. BUT A NICE SUMMARY OF THE TOPIC TOGETHER WITH SOME CODE SNIPPETS ARE AVAILABLE IN: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xorshift AND https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register
